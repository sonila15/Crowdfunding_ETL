The following database was created in PostgreSQL:
After creating four separate tables, the data was imported into each respective table. Once all the data was imported, we used SELECT * FROM tablename to show the outputs, as shown as below.
An ERD was also created, using QuickDBD, which can be referenced in the main branch. The ERD can help visualize the connection between the columns within each table; respective primary and foreign keys are designated to show these relationships.
